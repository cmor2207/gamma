# RNA-seq analysis (reference based approach)

## Repository

[GAMMA]("https://github.com/jleluyer/gamma")


## Objectives

- Find genes associated with GxE in reponse to temperature

- Identifiy putative splicing & SNPs

- Find cis-eQTL

- Find ancestry (Tremix)

- Test with both genome v2 + transcriptome 41k transcripts (Le Luyer et al. submitted)

- Test the mapping approach with GSNAP and split output function
